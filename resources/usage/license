USAGE

  fez li [-s]

  fez license [--set='']

FLAGS
  
  OPTIONAL

  -s|--set                sets the license for the current repo

If `-s` is not supplied then attempts to figure out what the current
repo's license is.  If `-s` IS supplied and fez knows about that
license then it will update the `LICENSE.txt` and `META6.json` files.

You can set the default license for `init` in your config file by
setting the key value "default-init-license": "..." in your
$HOME/.fez-config.json file.  You can ensure the string is correct by
running `fez init --license <...>`.
